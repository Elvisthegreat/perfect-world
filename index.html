          <h2>what is the world?</h2>
          <p>
            Many broken and hopeless one's have wonder today, thinking, what is
            this world really about? Is it to come, live and die without meaning
            or is there something behind just living? If you are one of those
            who has wondered this way or asked yourself this questions, don't
            feel embarassed for many feel's same as you.

          <h2>a thought of my past life</h2>
          <p>
            When i first learned about the truth, i felt goosebump all over me,
            because growing up i used to think this world is a place created for
            humans to grief, feel lost and die with sorrow, which is really
            true! but as soon as i started to make up time to study the bible
            with one of <strong> Jehovah </strong> Witnesses, i started to find
            out, that wasn't the main reason the world was created.. The world
            was created as a paradise with rules and as a gift to humans, but
            humans decided to break the rules and followed there own path which
            as lead their decendants to do the same. But there is still hope for
            everyone who are ready to listen and obey.
